# GNN-RANS-Flow
A graph neural network based surrogate model for steady-state (CFD) flow prediction.

This repository contains the work done during my master thesis at [Chair of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/maschinenwesen/ism/psm). The thesis report can be found here: [Surrogate modelling for fluid flow problems and application on cleaning model](https://sankalpjena.github.io/documents/master_thesis_SJena.pdf). The corresponding presentation during defense can be found [here](https://sankalpjena.github.io/documents/thesis_presentation_vFinal.pdf).

Computing resources were provided by [Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing, Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/zih).
